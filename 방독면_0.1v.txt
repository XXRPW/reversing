if statement

cmp dword ptr[ebp+8], 1
jnz short loc_40101C
mov eax, [ebp+8]
add eax, 1

with this expression we can think that this code indicates if(var1 == 1) section and the codes below that will be the events that will happen if the statement is true

loop statement
sourcecode:
int loop(int c){
int d;

for(int i=0; i<=0x100; i++){
c--;
d++;
}
return c+d;
}
in this case the codes will look like

mov eax,[ebp-8]
add eax,1
mov [ebp-8],eax

this section will be the i++ part which it moves ebp-8 to eax and add eax by 1 and moves the value of eax back to ebp-8
and furthermore, dword ptr[ebp-8] is the int i;


cmp dword ptr[ebp-8], 100h
jg short loc_401035

this indicates the i<=0x100 part as I said, ebp-8 is int i so it compares i with 100 and if i is greater then 100 it moves forward to the program to end


mov eax,[ebp+8]
add eax,[ebp-4]
mov esp,eebp
pop ebp retn

this part adds up variable c and d and returns it with the value added in eax 

mov ecx,[ebp+8]
sub ecx, 1
mov [ebp+8],ecx

mov[ebp-4],edx
jmp short loc_40100F

if variable i is smaller than 100 then it goes to this section of the code. 
as it shows like the 'jmp short loc_40100F' code, if it goes back up and back up there if it cmp with a specific value, you can think that code as a loop statement.
This is the basic format of a loop statement there are some situations that doesn't exactly follow this format and that will be taken in farthermore lessons.


data structure & API Call 

Now, first of all, it a code has

sub esp,54

you should know right away that the code is using 0x54 bytes
For exapmle if you are using a data structure STARTUPINFO and PROCESS_INFORMATION 
STARTUPINFO has a value of 0x44 and PROCESS_INFORMATION has a value of 0x10
so the total value will be 0x44+0x10 which is 0x54 and if the program subtracts 0x54 at the beginning you can also notice that the prgoram doesn't have any other variables except
the data structures.

usually for API Call it will push at the beginning which are the arguments and those arguments go in backwards following by the LIFO rule(LAST IN FIRST OUT)

DLL

First of all, what is a DLL?
DLL, Dynamic-link library, is icrosoft's implementation of the shared library concept in the Microsoft Windows and OS/2 operating systems. 
the image base of a DLL defers from the image base of an EXE file which is 0x10000000 and EXE has a image base value of 0x400000
but the base address can be different for dll.if there's another dll that is loaded up to 0x10000000.
to find the real image base it is truely simple to do this
you just see where the DLL is loaded and
